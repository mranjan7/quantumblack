My solution for data engineering hackathon by Quantumblack on Analytics Vidhya : https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/quantumblack-online-hackathon/

This was a data engineering hackathon and we do not have to make any machine learning models but generate features as required. It is good practice of generating great features for a real business case scenario (data related to car driving).
